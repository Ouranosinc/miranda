# This file defines the structure of the data on disk.
#
# The path-builder function parses this tree from top to bottom, always using the first match.
# Each child of the "datasets" top element may define the following fields:
#
#     with: # Section that decides if we use this element for the given file.
#       - option: < facet >         # A facet and its values to match
#         value: <value or values>  # this can be repeated
#     structure: # The path structure, each element is mapped to a folder level
#       # There are four ways to specify a folder name to use:
#       # Each way can be used recursively in place for < facet >.
#       - < facet >           # If the facet is missing, this level is skipped, resulting in a tree of a different depth.
#       - option: < facet >   # A test on the given facet's value.
#         value: < value >    # Optional. If not given, the test is simple "facet is not empty"
#         is_true: < facet >  # Optional. Facet to use if the test passes. If not given, this level is skipped resulting in a tree of a different depth.
#         else: < facet > # Optional. Facet to use if the test fails. Same consequence as above if not given.
#       - [< facet >, < facet >, ...]:  # The folder name consists in more than one facet, concatenated with a "_" by default.
#       - text: < value >     # A fixed string
#     filename: # The file name schema, a list of facet names. If a facet is empty, it will be skipped. Elements will be separated by "_".
#               # The special "DATES" facet will be replaced by the most concise way found to define the temporal range covered by the file.

### Raw data

# This structure is meant for raw-like data, usually hourly or daily, used as input for scenario projects.
# It includes bias-adjusted datasets.
